      </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The agenda for this week is to set up meetings with the client to ask questions. I would like the team to be familiarized with OneNote so that they can be equipped to take notes and start diagramming. I would also like to assess the information gathered by the team by the end of the week to see if the team is asking the right questions.</p>

          February 3, 2020 - Weekly Agenda 
      </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The agenda for this week is to start brainstorming with possible solutions. I would like the team to meet up minimum 3 times this week to discuss solutions. I would also like for at least 1 team member to serve as "devil's advocate" so that "groupthink" is minimized. By the end of the week, I want to hear all the brainstormed solutions so that I can assess them.</p>
